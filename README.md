# Data-Science
These projects are the result of the course of Data Science.

## Warming Up

## EDA
Process raw data to create new meaningful data.
* Bike-Sharing  
  Compute daily totals and other meaningful features from the Washington, D.C. bike-sharing system.
* Trump-and-Tweets

## Spam Classification
The goal is to classify which mail is spam or ham.  
For build classification model, do feature engineering and EDA.  
Then apply meaningful features in Logistic Regression.  
Finally, calculate confusion matrix, Precision-Recall Curve and ROC Curve for evaluating classifiers.  

## Predicting Housing Prices
